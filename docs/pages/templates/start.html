<p>Learn how to create a website with Aurora.</p>

<h3 id="install-aurora">Install Aurora</h3>
<p>First, install Aurora:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> aurora-ssg
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-site">Create a Site</h3>
<p>To create a new site, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">aurora new my-site
cd my-site
</code></pre>
<p>
    This will create a folder called
    <code>my-site</code> with everything you need to start your Aurora site.
</p>
<p>There are two ways to run Aurora:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>aurora build</strong>: This command builds your site into a folder called <code>_site</code>, which you can view on your file system.</li>
    <li><strong>aurora serve</strong>: This command builds your site and starts a local server at <code>http://localhost:8000</code> on which your site will run. This is ideal for development.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see your site locally, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">aurora serve</code></pre>
<p>
    This will start a local server at
    <code>http://localhost:8000</code> on which your site will run.
</p>

<p>When you are ready to publish your site, you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">aurora build</code></pre>

<p>This will build your site into a folder called <code>_site</code>, which you can then upload to a web server.</p>

<p>You have started an Aurora website ðŸŽ‰.</p>
