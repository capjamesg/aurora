<p>robots.txt files let you tell search engines which pages they can and can't index.</p>

<p>To define a robots.txt file, create a file called robots.txt in your <code>pages/templates/</code> directory.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a robots.txt file that lets all bots crawl all pages, and points to your sitemap for reference:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: /sitemap.xml
</code></pre>
